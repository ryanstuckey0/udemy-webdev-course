# Section 12- Building Websites that People Love

## Color Theory

- Pick colors that correspond to how you want your users to feel
  - Red- love, energy, intensity
  - Yellow- joy, intellect, attention
  - Green- freshness, growth, safety
  - Blue- stability, trust, serenity
  - Purple- royalty, wealth, feminity
- Combining colors
  - Analogous colors- two colors next to each other on the color wheel
    - Good for navigation elements of website
  - Complementary colors- two colors on opposite sides of the color wheel
    - Better for making things pop; draws more attention
    - Don't use for text, only for things like logos or icons
- Adobe Color website includes a color wheel that can be used to pick combinations of colors: [color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
- Color Hunt also has tons of color palettes put together by designers- [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/)

## Understanding Typography and Choosing a Font

- Two main families- serif and sans-serif
- Serif has little "feet" on the ends
  - Useful for more serious, authoritative, and older feelings
  - Comes in a couple different flavors- old-style, traditional, modern
- Sans-serif has no feet
  - Looks more friendly and approachable
- Combining too many fonts can make the design look over complicated and unprofessional
- It is better to combine two fonts
  - Choose similar font "moods"
  - Add some contrast by using serif and sans-serif, or by varying the weight

## Effective UI Design

- Define hierarchy by varying the size and weight of fonts
- Define important information by increasing the font size, changing to higher contrast colors, or increasing size
- Use non-text elements to emphasize some text
- Aim for 40-60 characters per line
- Alignment- arrange title and body text to be aligned
  - Can also make text look more professional by reducing the number of "alignment points"
- Using white space
  - Adding white space between elements can make the website look fancier and more luxurious 
- Design for your audience
  - i.e. designing something for children vs adults

## Effective UX Design

- Aim for simplicity over complexity
  - Don't over-clutter website
- Keep design and functionality consistent across whole website
  - Use same navigation elements, menus etc.
- Can use the F-layout to design text and content
  - Have most import content at top, and then follow the left gutter down
